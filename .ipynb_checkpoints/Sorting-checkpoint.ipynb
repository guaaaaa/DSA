    "Heap sort first converts the array into a max heap (for ascending order) or a min heap (for descending order). This conversion happens in place using the heapify process.  Once the heap is built, the root node (largest element in a max heap) is swapped with the last element, effectively placing it in its final sorted position. Then, the heap size is reduced, and heapify is applied to restore the heap structure. This process is repeated until the array is fully sorted\n",
